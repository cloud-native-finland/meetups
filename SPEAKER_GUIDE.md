## Speaker guide for CNCF & Kubernetes meetups

First off, thank you for volunteering to speak at our meetups!
Your contributions are very appreciated, and is what keeps us all moving forward.

#### Respect the Community

We'd like to remind everybody (especially speakers and sponsors) that these meetups
are **community events**. We're here to discuss problems, ideas, solutions and technical
challenges ahead to better understand each other and move forward together. We're **not**
attending meetups to pitch or sell any products, to favor a specific company's solutions,
or to talk badly about competitors. This is a good place to say that _all our meetups_
**follow the [CNCF][cncf-coc] and [The Linux Foundation][lf-coc] Code of Conducts**.

#### Before the meetup

 - Apply to speak at a Finnish CNCF & Kubernetes meetup at: https://bit.ly/k8sfin-cfp
 - The organizers will get back to you via email and confirm your speaking slot if it
   made it into the agenda.
 - Discuss any outstanding questions with the organizer and accept the speaking slot,
   preferably the title and short abstract shall be available around a week before the meetup.

#### At the meetup

 - Arrive at least 15 minutes before the meetup starts (most often 6pm)
 - Normal presentation speaking slots are 20-30 minutes, lightning talks around 10 minutes,
   including Q&A. The venue host presentation is around 5 minutes.
 - Preferably, bring your own laptop. If you don't, let the organizers know in beforehand.
 - (Optional) Bring your company's or favorite project's swag, e.g. stickers to the "swag table".
 - (Optional) Let the organizers know your Twitter handle, and they will tweet about your talk
   using that. Also, feel free to retweet ;)

#### After the meetup

 - If you had any specific feedback around how the meetup felt, let the organizers know
 - Please upload your presentation so that it is publicly accessible afterwards, e.g. using
   [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).


Again, thank you for speaking at our meetup!
