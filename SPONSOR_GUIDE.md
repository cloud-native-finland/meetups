## Sponsor guide for the CNCF & Kubernetes meetup

This is a community event, but it wouldn't live on for long without
companies sponsoring the events. Hence, sponsors are important to the
health of the project. Thank you for sponsoring our events!

#### Respect the Community

We'd like to remind everybody (especially speakers and sponsors) that these meetups
are **community events**. We're here to discuss problems, ideas, solutions and technical
challenges ahead to better understand each other and move forward together. We're **not**
attending meetups to pitch or sell any products, to favor a specific company's solutions,
or to talk badly about competitors. This is a good place to say that _all our meetups_
**follow the [CNCF][cncf-coc] and [The Linux Foundation][lf-coc] Code of Conducts**.

### Venue sponsors

This is the most common form of sponsoring our events -- to open up your office
to the community and let us be there for an evening. Venue sponsors get
a 30 minute speaking slot for a suitable talk (if they want). It is expected that
the venue sponsor also provides food and drinks to the meetup participants. If this
can't be arranged, a dedicated food/drinks sponsor should be found instead, or some
of the long-term sponsors will chime in. The only vendor-pitchy talk that is OK, is
the dedicated 5 minute venue sponsor pitch. This talk may let the participants
know what the company does, what they sell, or what kind of people they're hiring.
The venue should have a good enough internet connection to host a Youtube livestream.

### Long-term sponsors

Long-term sponsor multiple meetups in a row for a period of time. They help with
practical costs where needed (travel, stickers, etc.), as well as valuable
equipment. They might also sponsor the meetup with valuable services, or people
helping the meetup in various ways. The long-term sponsors will in some way be
mentioned or visible at every applicable meetup.

Again, thank you for sponsoring our meetup!
